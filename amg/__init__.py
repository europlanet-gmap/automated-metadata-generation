class UnifiedMetadata():
    """

    This class is the primary means by which this library is intended
    to be used. Specifically, this class takes a number of other
    metadata objects from disparate sources and seeks to homogenize 
    the input data into a single container.

    This class overrides attribute lookups (__getattr__) and uses the
    following logic in order to find a given attribute:

    1. If the attribute is provided in the overrides dict, return the value
    for the given key.

    2. If the attribute is in the mappings dict, the user has specified that
    the value should come from a specific source. Perform the attribute lookup
    on that source.
    
    3. Iterate over each source in the input sources list and build a dict
    of found attributes where the key is source and the value is the returned value.
    For example: {'SourceA':'foo', 'SourceB':'foo', 'SourceC':'bar}.
    
    4. If the previous step returns more than one instance of the source, warn the user
    and request that a mapping be provided to disambiguate the metadata source.
    
    5. If the attribute can not be found, warn the user.
    
    6. Return the attribute requested to the caller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    overrides : dict
                in the form {'key':'value'}

    mappings : dict
               in the form {'key':class}, where class is one of the class definitions passed
               in the sources list (e.g., IsisMetadata or GDALMetadata)
